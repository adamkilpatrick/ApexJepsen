## What is it?
Hoping this project ends up being a solid framework for reliably getting usable data out of apex legends matches. Goals are to always keep options open as far as extensions go. If people want to make mapping tools, twitterbots, graphs, meta-games, hopefully this provides them with the necessary data to do so.
## How do I use it?
ATM waiting on some stuff, hopefulyl if you are reading this you know me. Ping me and I will hook you up with the necessary workarounds.
## TODO
- Flesh out heatmapping / break into separate project
- Setup event based webhook system (e.g. hit an HTTP endpoint on kill/death/win)
- Setup centralized record repository to be later used for aggregate heatmaps / data analytics things
- Add examples to input/output
- Scrub providers of all this garbage sample data
- Figure out user install/run path
- KC map image is kind of hacked out of a screenshot + MSPaint, should probably make something cleaner
- Maps are about to start changing on schedule, need to figure that out for heatmap stuff
- Deffo need some unit tests
- Yo I'd kill for some CI/CD
